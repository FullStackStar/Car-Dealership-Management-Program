# Car-Dealership-Management-Program
This project, which is a topic of the Fundamentals of Programming course, involves creating a car dealership management entirely in C++. We are pleased to announce the release of a convenient console application for performing management system tasks like adding new car(s) to a data set, modifying and deleting car(s) from a data set, exporting order logs, etc.

## Programming Paradigms & Principles Used

* Object-Oriented Programming
* Procedural Programming
* Code Reusability
* File Handling

## How to Use
The user must first log in; if they do not already have an account, they can utilize the 'Guest' or public entry option.
Once in the Main, all users may proceed to order Toyota cars.
However, only those with admin level access may view the order logs and edit a car's data. Administrators must answer for their conduct.
